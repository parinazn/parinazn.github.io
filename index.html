I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ise.osu.edu/">Integrated Systems Engineering</a> and <a href="https://ece.osu.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> Departments at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a>. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://tdai.osu.edu">Translational Data Analytics Institute</a>. 

<p>
My research interests are in network economics, game theory, algorithmic economics, and reinforcement learning. Specifically, my group studies <em>decision making and learning in networks</em> (network games and multi-agent reinforcement learning), <em>fairness in AI</em> (data biases and long-term impacts with human-in-the-loop), and <em>economics of cyber security</em> (incentive design and data analytics). Our research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Amazon, and Cisco.
