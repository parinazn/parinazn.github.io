I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.ece.ucsd.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> department and <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu">The Design Lab</a> at the <a href="https://ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a>. 

<p>
My research interests are in network economics, game theory, ethics and economics of AI, and reinforcement learning. Specifically, my group studies <em>decision making and learning in networks</em> (network games and multi-agent reinforcement learning), <em>fairness in AI</em> (data biases and long-term impacts with human-in-the-loop), and <em>economics of cyber security</em> (incentive design and data analytics). Our research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Amazon, and Cisco.
