I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.ece.ucsd.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> department and <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu">The Design Lab</a> at the <a href="https://ucsd.edu">University of California, San Diego</a>. 

<p>
My research interests are in network economics, game theory, ethics and economics of AI, and reinforcement learning. I lead the <a href="group">MINDS lab</a>, where we study <em>decision making and learning in networks</em> (network games, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and learning for optimization in networks/graphs), and <em>ethical and microeconomic considerations when designing AI systems</em> (including data biases, algorithmic fairness, and strategic human-in-the-loop). Our research has been generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Amazon, and Cisco.
