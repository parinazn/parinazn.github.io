I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://ise.osu.edu/">Integrated Systems Engineering</a> and <a href="https://ece.osu.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> Departments at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a>. I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://tdai.osu.edu">Translational Data Analytics Institute</a>. 


<h4>Research interests:</h4>
<p>
I study learning and decision making, particularly in network environments and when agents are rational, and examine how information and incentive design can influence agents' behavior in these environments. My research contributes to and draws from several disciplines, including network economics, game theory, algorithmic economics, optimization, and reinforcement learning.
