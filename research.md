Our group studies distributed learning and decision making, particularly in network environments, and examines how strategic reasoning, information, and incentive design can shape individual and network-level outcomes. We contribute to, and draw from, tools and methods in several disciplines, including network economics, game theory, algorithmic economics, optimization, and control theory. Our work is generously supported by the __National Science Foundation (NSF)__, __Amazon__, and __Cisco__.

<h2 id="network-games">Network Economics: Games on Networks</h2>

The outcomes of many social and economic interactions, such as public good provision, spread of research and innovation, and contagion in financial networks, are governed by an underlying network of connections between their users. 
When participants are rational and self-interested, such interactions can be modeled as network games. 
Our research in this area is focused on identifying the effects of the network topology on equilibrium analysis and comparative statics of these games. 
The findings are of importance to network design and policy interventions.

<h2 id="MLecon">Economics and Ethics of AI-Driven Decision Making</h2>

The wide-spread adoption of AI and ML tools for decision making raises questions about the fundamental performance, privacy, and fairness guarantees of algorithmic decision making,
particularly in the presence of strategic participants. These may include the agents providing the data used in the learning algorithms (e.g., in crowdsourcing),
as well as the strategic agents who are governed by such decision rules. 
Our research in this area analyzes the incentives of such strategic agents and their interactions with AI/ML algorithms, as well as the impacts of data biases on the performance and fairness guarantees of these algorithms.

<h2 id="MARL">Reinforcement Learning on Networks</h2>

Reinforcement learning techniques have been receiving increasing attention due to their applications in robotics, games, resource management, and bidding and advertising.
Our work in this area focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning, wherein both agentsâ€™ learning and their performance (payoffs) become intertwined. 
We are particularly interested in the effects of information asymmetry and information sharing in this class of problems. 
In addition, we have explored the use of reinforcement learning in an edge computing paradigm for enabling secure and personalized augmented reality (AR) experiences.

<h2 id="cybersecurity">Cyber Security: Incentive Design and Data Analytics</h2>

The increasing number and costs of cyber incidents, affecting both industry and government sectors, has drawn increasing attention to the issue of cyber security. 
Our work in this area identifies incentive mechanisms and policy interventions that can motivate better security decisions by end users and organizations.
Our approach combines theoretical models and data analytics to propose such tools for improving cyber security.
Specifically, we have explored the design of cyber insurance contracts so as to incentivize improved security investments by organizations, as well as using data analytics for quantifying and predicting cyber security risks.
