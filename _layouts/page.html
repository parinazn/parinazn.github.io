Our goal is to incorporate analytical models of human decision making in the design of socio-technical networks and AI systems, to understand how the interactions of humans and/or AI agents with misaligned (economic) incentives and diverse reasoning capabilities can impact the performance, fairness, robustness, and security of these systems. <br><br>
