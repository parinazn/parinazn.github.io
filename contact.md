<h4 id="prospective"> A note to prospective students </h4>
<p>
I am looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students, with a strong mathematical background and interest in interdisciplinary research, to join our research group. I recruit students from both ISE and ECE. If you are interested in joining our group, please apply directly to the graduate program in either ISE or ECE depending on your background and interests, and mention my name in your application. If you would like to send me an email, please include your CV and a brief description of your research experience and interests.

<p> If you are a B.Sc. or M.Sc. student at OSU interested in our group's research, please send me an email, and include your CV and a brief description of any past research experience.</p>
